Lo! To those who dare to hold this creation in their hands, I grant you the liberty, unshackled and unbound, to wield, copy, reshape, merge, proclaim, distribute, sell, or surrender this work, as your will commands, yet never forgetting the weight of freedom.

Let it be known: this notice, this mark of origin, shall accompany all that you do with it, lest the act forget its genesis.

This work is laid bare "AS IS," stripped of assurances, promises, or comforts—no guarantee of its virtue, its purpose, or its survival. In the labyrinth of consequence, neither the author nor any holder of this spark shall bear the burden for any loss, pain, or misfortune that may arise from its embrace.

Thus, with boldness tempered by thought, use, transform, and unleash this work upon the world.
